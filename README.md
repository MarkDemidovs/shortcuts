# what is shortcuts?
shortcuts is a small software for simplifying different command actions on (currently only) Linux.

# what can you currently do with shortcuts?
Currently, you can quickly restart, shutdown, hibernate, and create your own custom command.

# how do you run it?
 ## Linux 
  ### You must install the C++ compiler first,
   https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/howto-compile-and-run-c-cplusplus-code-in-linux/

  ### Then, 9 times out of 10, you'll have to compile the program, 
  do this by using the terminal and CD (changing the directory) to the program, and typing
  > g++ main.cpp
  then, to run it, type
  > ./a.out
 ## More systems coming soon.
 
 ## That is it!

# How do you use it?


# What will be added in the future?
 In the future, there probably will be added:
 ## Program reprogrammed in C
  This is for speed reasons.
 ## More (or dynamic) slots for custom commands.
   Unlimited commands means unlimited possibilities.
 ## Command Management
  Deleting commands, editing commands, all of that stuff.
 ## Windows / Mac ports
  Probably the easiest one, but ill have to complete everything else before porting.
 ## Saving custom shortcuts
  Literally explained by the title - and probably the next one im going to add.
